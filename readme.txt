Current Story:
Now if you've tried the game out already then you'll be wondering why I've called it "Space Quest", the simple reason is its about a floaty island thingy(I don't know what else to calle it) that is inhabited primarily by elves, dwarves, orcs and men. The land is divided into quarters and each race inhabits a quarter each, and then finally in the centre of the island is the palace of the god who created the island. The story starts with a trip to see the god in the palace as a representative of your race, the humans. Your request of the god is that he grant your race more land (hence, "Space Quest"), as your numbers were growing too fast and the land was becoming overcrowded. This was because the lifespan of humans was so short whereas elves were immortal and orcs and dwarves had lifespans a many times the length of the human race. The god didn't actually like the humans very much either, they died too easily and in his opinion he thought they were weak, so he offered you a whole new land, where the men could live by themselves, and it would last them for many millions of years before they could ever dream of filling it up. But he would only do this if you collected 4 viles of the elements created by the 4 wizards in each sector of the island. Of course the wizards were well protected by beasts and traps so only the strongest and smartest being could ever get to him, this was to stop the orcs from ever getting hold of kind of magic these wizards possessed. So thats where it begins, you go off in your quest to retreive the 4 viles you need.

Anthing you think would be helpful in a game, feel free to apply.
Some standard areas are:
Art

Extra:
Combat in the game is likely to be low in manual combat(ie, swords and clubs...) and higher in magical combat, using spells to defeat certain types of enemies(ie, a water or wind spell would be highly effective against a fire demon...).
Currently Space Quest is planned to be a fully single player game, although once the game is completed the idea of making an online sequel is going to be considered, probably set before the characters quest, where you can be either a human, elf, dwarf or orc.
